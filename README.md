## ¡Hola! 🙋🏻‍♂️

Hey there, I’m Miguel! I’m a **Physicist** and a **Machine Learning Engineer**, focused on building ML systems that actually work in real-world production environments. 
I’m all about turning complex ideas into practical solutions that make a difference.

I also love sharing my ML journey and helping others break into the field — no matter where you’re starting from.

Always open to cool new projects, collaborations, or just connecting. Feel free to reach out on socials or drop a PR! 💪
